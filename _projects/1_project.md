Using machine learning, deep neural networks, and multi-modal large language models, our group trains AI models to understand surgical video at an expert level.
Such models are used to investigate perception of surgical video information, supplement surgical education and assist with prospective surgical action decision making {% cite skinner2024digmed %}.
