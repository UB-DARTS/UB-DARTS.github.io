Our group investigates the application of the clinically novel laser speckle contrast imaging. This technology helps surgeons assess tissue perfusion without the use of contrast dye, that is required with indocyanine green fluorescence. {% cite NWAIWU20233083 %}

We have shown that subjecdtive interpretation of LSCI is equivalent to ICG in left-sided colorectal resections.{% cite skinner2024dcr %}, and that objective quantification of LSCI is equivalent to quantification of ICG in pre-clinical porcine model. {% cite skinner2024surgendosc %}
