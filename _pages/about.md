The University at Buffalo Data Augmented Research Technology in Surgery (DARTS) laboratory is a unique collaboration between surgeon innovators and machine learning scientists. Together we investigate novel applications of artificial intelligence, computer vision, near-infrared imaging and large language models in surgery to improve surgical education, improve patient outcomes, and democratize surgical expertise.
