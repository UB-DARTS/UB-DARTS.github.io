  abstract={Surgical artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve patient safety and clinical outcomes. To date, training such AI models to identify tissue anatomy requires annotations by expensive and ratelimiting surgical domain experts. Herein, we demonstrate and validate a methodology to obtain high quality surgical tissue annotations through crowdsourcing of non-experts, and real-time deployment of multimodal surgical anatomy AI model in colorectal surgery},

  title={Clinical Utility of Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging and Real-Time Quantification of Bowel Perfusion in Minimally Invasive Left-Sided Colorectal Resections},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Left-sided colorectal surgery demonstrates high anastomotic leak rates, with tissue ischemia thought to influence outcomes. Indocyanine green is commonly used for perfusion assessment, but evidence remains mixed for whether it reduces colorectal anastomotic leaks. Laser speckle contrast imaging provides dye-free perfusion assessment in real-time through perfusion heat maps and quantification. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the efficacy of advanced visualization (indocyanine green versus laser speckle contrast imaging), perfusion assessment, and utility of laser speckle perfusion quantification in determining ischemic margins. DESIGN: Prospective intervention group using advanced visualization with case-matched, retrospective control group. SETTINGS: Single academic medical center. PATIENTS: Forty adult patients undergoing elective, minimally invasive, left-sided colorectal surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Intraoperative perfusion assessment using white light imaging and advanced visualization at 3 time points: T1—proximal colon after devascularization, before transection, T2—proximal/distal colon before anastomosis, and T3—completed anastomosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraoperative indication of ischemic line of demarcation before resection under each visualization method, surgical decision change using advanced visualization, post hoc laser speckle perfusion quantification of colorectal tissue, and 30-day postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: Advanced visualization changed surgical decision-making in 17.5% of cases. For cases in which surgeons changed a decision, the average discordance between the line of demarcation in white light imaging and advanced visualization was 3.7 cm, compared to 0.41 cm (p=0.01) for cases without decision changes.There was no statistical difference between the line of ischemic demarcation using laser speckle versus indocyanine green (p=0.16). Laser speckle quantified lower perfusion values for tissues beyond the line ofischemic demarcation while suggesting an additional 1 cm of perfused tissue beyond this line. One (2.5%) anastomotic leak occurred in the intervention group. LIMITATIONS: This study was not powered to detect differences in anastomotic leak rates. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced visualization using laser speckle and indocyanine green provides valuable perfusion information that impacts surgical },

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
